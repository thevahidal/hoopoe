## About

There are some important stuff that we must be aware of, like when they exceed some sort of limits or when they start setting fire to your house. In the company that I work, we had this burning desire for a system that send us alert when some stuff happens, right away. 
As you already know the only thing that we always carry around is our phones, so we thought what is better than getting a notification in those cases! That's why I started this project, it's supposed to help us and anyone else dealing with these kind of issues. 

**Hoopoe** is meant to be real straight forward, when you want get notified of a certain thing, just call Hoopoe and Hoopoe make sure to send you a notification.

```python
    # In your code...
    if that_thing_happened:
        hoopoe.call("The thing that we don't like happened!", extra={
            "where": "Alex's House",
            "type": "Cops",
            "how_bad": "4/5"
        })

    
    # And right away in your inbox...
    # Hoopoe Upupa | New Notification: The thing that we don't like happened!
    
    # When
    # Thu, Dec 23, 2021, 09:17 PM UTC
    # Info
    # {
    #   "where": "Alex's House",
    #   "type": "Cops",
    #   "how_bad": "4/5"
    # }

```

<summary>Why Hoopoe? The story behind the name.</summary>
<br>

Looking for a name that's both beautiful and meaningful, I started to google for ancient gods and heroes that are somehow related to delivering messages. There were some candidates but Hermes was the leading one, but since it's used so many times decided to go with another one, which ended up with **Hoopoe**. Hoopoe served King Solomon as a delivery man (animal?), so I thought why not! It's a cute animal and the name sticks!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The recommended way to use **Hoopoe** is by using [Hoopoe.app](https://hoopoe.app) which take away the pain of deploying and maintaining Hoopoe on your own (Coming Soon!). For manual usage please refer to [manual setup section](#manual-setup).

### Cloud vs. On-premise

Hoopoe core is a RESTful API. Either you're using the Hoopoe.app or your own deployment, you can refer to [API docs (Coming Soon!)](https://docs.hoopoe.app) to read more about APIs.

<!-- ![Preview](docs/images/preview.svg) -->

#### Manual setup

There are two ways to deploy Hoopoe:

1. Using docker image **(Recommended)** (Coming Soon!)
    - Either build your own docker image using the Dockerfile
    - Or using the latest image on [Dockerhub (Coming Soon!)](https://hub.docker.com/thevahidal/hoopoe-core)
2. Manual deployment, you can use [this awesome article by Digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-20-04) on how to deploy a django project to production environment
    - Please make sure to serve your deployment over HTTPS (Important)
    - This project is actively updating, make sure to update your deployment often
    - Duplicate ```.env_```, rename it to ```.env``` and fill the required environment variables [See here](#variables-reference)
        
        ```bash
            cp .env_ .env
            nano .env
        ```
